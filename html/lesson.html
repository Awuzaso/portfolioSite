            <h1>Understanding Document Flow</h1>
            <p><em>Document flow</em> describes the way HTML elements are rendered in the browser window. By studying it we can better understand things like the width and height of elements, and what order to write our HTML in. When you understand the default behavior of elements, you can work with their exisitng behavior to write better and more efficient code  rather than fighting or forcing them to bvehave the way you want.</p>
